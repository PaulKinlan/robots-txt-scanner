# Active Context: Robots.txt Analyzer CLI

## Current Focus

- Updating the project's Memory Bank documentation (`memory-bank/` directory).
- Analyzing the existing codebase (`index.js`, `list_downloader.js`, `scanner.js`, `db_manager.js`, `package.json`) to accurately document the project's state, architecture, and functionality.

## Recent Changes (High-Level)

- Updated `memory-bank/projectbrief.md` with core requirements, goals, and scope based on code analysis.
- Updated `memory-bank/productContext.md` with problem statement, target audience, and user experience goals.
- Updated `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` with architecture description, key technical decisions, component breakdown, and data flows.
- Updated `memory-bank/techContext.md` with core technologies, setup instructions, constraints, and dependencies.

## Next Steps

- Update `memory-bank/progress.md` to reflect the current state of implemented features and known status.
- Complete the "update memory bank" task.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- Ensuring the documentation accurately reflects the code's current capabilities and limitations (e.g., the simple text parsing for blocked agents vs. full `robots-parser` usage).
- Maintaining consistency across the different memory bank files.

## Important Patterns & Preferences

- Following the structure and purpose outlined for each Memory Bank file (`.clinerules`).
- Deriving documentation content directly from code analysis.

## Learnings & Insights

- The project is a functional Node.js CLI tool for downloading a domain list, scanning `robots.txt` files concurrently, performing basic identification of blocked user agents, and storing/querying results in an SQLite database.
- Key libraries (`yargs`, `node-fetch`, `p-queue`, `better-sqlite3`, `adm-zip`) define its core technical capabilities.
- The `robots-parser` dependency exists but isn't currently used for the core agent blocking logic.

_(This file is the most dynamic. Update it frequently to reflect the current state of work, decisions, and immediate plans. It bridges the gap between the high-level context and the day-to-day progress.)_
