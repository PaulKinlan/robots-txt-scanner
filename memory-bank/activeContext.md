# Active Context: Robots.txt Analyzer CLI

## Current Focus

- Implementing `--max-rank` filtering for the `scan` command.
- Storing the site rank in the database during scanning.

## Recent Changes (High-Level)

- **Added `--max-rank` Option:**
  - Modified `index.js` to add a `--max-rank` (`-r`) option to the `scan` command using `yargs`.
  - Refactored `index.js` `scan` command definition to use separate builder/handler functions for clarity and to resolve linter issues.
  - Passed the `maxRank` value from `index.js` to `scanner.js`.
- **Implemented Rank Filtering:**
  - Modified `scanner.js` (`scanSites` function) to accept `maxRank`.
  - Added logic to parse the rank from the input CSV line.
  - Added logic to skip processing domains whose rank exceeds `maxRank` (if provided).
- **Stored Rank in Database:**
  - Modified `db_manager.js` (`initDb` function) to add a `rank INTEGER` column to the `sites` table schema.
  - Updated the `insertSiteStmt` prepared statement in `db_manager.js` to include the `rank`.
  - Modified the `addScanResult` transaction function in `db_manager.js` to accept the `rank` and pass it during site insertion.
  - Passed the parsed `rank` from `scanner.js` to `dbManager.addScanResult`.
- **Updated URL Handling in Scanner:**
  - Modified `scanner.js` based on user feedback clarifying the input list contains full URLs (e.g., `https://www.example.com`), not just domains.
  - The `scanSites` function now reads the second CSV column as `baseUrl`.
  - The `fetchRobotsTxt` function now accepts `baseUrl`, uses the `URL` constructor to find the origin, and constructs the correct `/robots.txt` path relative to that origin (e.g., `https://www.example.com/robots.txt`).
  - The URL stored in the database is now the constructed `robots.txt` URL.
- **Added DB Schema Migration:**
  - Modified `db_manager.js` (`initDb` function) to check if the `rank` column exists in the `sites` table using `PRAGMA table_info`.
  - If the `rank` column is missing (e.g., when running against an older DB file), it's added using `ALTER TABLE sites ADD COLUMN rank INTEGER`. This resolves the `SqliteError: table sites has no column named rank`.
- **Fixed Linter/Syntax Errors:** Addressed syntax issues identified by the linter during modifications in `index.js` and `scanner.js`.

## Next Steps

- Update `progress.md` to reflect the new features, URL handling, and schema migration.
- Update `systemPatterns.md` to reflect the URL handling and schema migration.
- Update `techContext.md` to reflect the URL handling, input format assumption, and schema migration technique.
- Present the completed task to the user.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- The rank is only stored when a site is _first_ inserted via `INSERT OR IGNORE`. Subsequent scans finding the same site URL will not update the rank. This assumes the rank from the initial scan source is canonical.
- Ensured changes were compatible with existing logic (e.g., passing `dbManager` instance).

## Important Patterns & Preferences

- Following the structure and purpose outlined for each Memory Bank file (`.clinerules`).
- Updating Memory Bank files after implementing significant features.
- Addressing linter/syntax errors promptly.

## Learnings & Insights

- Refactoring `yargs` command definitions into separate builder/handler functions can improve code readability and sometimes resolve subtle syntax issues.
- Careful handling of parameters passed between modules (`index.js` -> `scanner.js` -> `db_manager.js`) is crucial.
- `better-sqlite3`'s `INSERT OR IGNORE` behavior needs consideration when adding new columns that should only be set on initial creation.
