# Project Progress: Robots.txt Analyzer CLI

## Current Status

- The core functionality of the CLI tool is implemented and appears functional based on code analysis.
- It can download the domain list, scan domains concurrently, perform basic blocked agent identification, store results in SQLite, query a basic report, and reset the database.
- The project is in a state where it can be run locally for its intended purpose.
- No automated tests are present.

## What Works

- **Domain List Download (`download-list` command):** Status: Fully Implemented. Fetches the zip, extracts the CSV, cleans up.
- **URL Scanning (`scan` command):** Status: Fully Implemented. Reads CSV (format: `rank,url`), uses `p-queue` for concurrency, constructs `/robots.txt` path from URL origin, fetches `robots.txt`, performs basic text parsing for blocked agents, stores results (robots.txt URL, rank) in DB. Includes `--max-rank` option to filter input list.
- **Database Management (`db_manager.js`):** Status: Fully Implemented. Initializes SQLite DB, creates schema (`sites` table with `url` (for robots.txt) and `rank` column, `blocked_agents` table, index), handles insertions via transactions (including storing rank on initial site insert), provides query functions, handles DB closing.
- **Blocked Agent Query (`query --report blocked-agents` command):** Status: Fully Implemented. Queries the database using `GROUP BY`/`COUNT(*)` and displays the results.
- **Sites with No Blocked Agents Query (`query --report no-blocked-agents` command):** Status: Fully Implemented. Queries the database using a `LEFT JOIN` and `COUNT` to find sites with no entries in `blocked_agents`.
- **Database Reset (`reset-db` command):** Status: Fully Implemented. Drops tables and re-initializes the schema.
- **CLI Structure (`index.js` / `yargs`):** Status: Fully Implemented. Defines commands, options, help text.

## What's Left to Build

- **Automated Tests:** Priority: High. No tests exist to verify functionality or prevent regressions.
- **More Sophisticated `robots.txt` Parsing:** Priority: Medium/Low (depending on goals). The current text parsing is basic. Using `robots-parser` library fully could allow for more accurate rule interpretation (Allow, path specificity, wildcards).
- **Further Advanced Querying/Reporting:** Priority: Medium. Two reports now exist (`blocked-agents`, `no-blocked-agents`). Could add more complex reports (e.g., sites without robots.txt, specific agent blocking patterns across site categories if categories were added).
- **Configuration File:** Priority: Low. Settings like `CONCURRENCY`, `REQUEST_TIMEOUT`, `USER_AGENT`, DB path are hardcoded. Could move to a config file.
- **Input Validation:** Priority: Medium. More robust validation could be added (e.g., checking CSV format more thoroughly).
- **User Confirmation for `reset-db`:** Priority: Medium. Currently just logs a warning; should have an interactive prompt. (TODO noted in `index.js`).

## Known Issues & Bugs

- **Potential Rate Limiting:** Severity: Medium. High concurrency might get the tool blocked by servers. Status: Open (No mitigation implemented).
- **Basic `robots.txt` Parsing Limitations:** Severity: Medium. May misinterpret complex rules or fail on non-standard formats. Status: Open (By design for current scope).
- **Noisy Logging:** Severity: Low. `better-sqlite3` verbose logging is enabled, might be too much for regular use. Status: Open.
- **Error Handling Granularity:** Severity: Low. Some errors are caught generally; more specific handling could improve diagnostics. Status: Open.
